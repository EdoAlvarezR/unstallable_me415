    "1) When we decided to choose a canard configuration, we knew that there would be significant interactions between the leading forward stabilizer and the trailing main wing.  We thought that the simple example VLM calculation and GUI provided by Dr. Ning would only be partially suitable for our main wing design.  Following the logic of Ilan Kroo in his \"Fundamental Comparison of Canards and Conventional Configurations\", we would have needed to design the main wing and canard such that the combination of lift was elliptical.  This would have required a significant amount of manual iteration with the provided GUI, so we decided to use the open source FLOWVLM code (https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWVLM) in conjunction with SNOPT (https://github.com/byuflowlab/Snopt.jl) as the engine for gradient based optimization.  The code used to generate these results can be found at: https://github.com/EdoAlvarezR/unstallable_me415.\n",

    "Becuase this is still in the fundamental design stages, we used our previous analyses and assumptions to set the chords for both the canard and wing.  After getting the model into the required format and plotting it, we decided to add sweep and taper on the main wing for aesthetic purposes.  An image of the starting design can be seen below.  The fuselage was not included in the induced drag or lift calculations.\n",

    "The optimization was set up as the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Objective:        minimize total drag\n",
    "    Constraints:      Canard lift within 20% of main wing lift\n",
    "                      Lift is greater than weight\n",
    "    Design Variables: Canard twist\n",
    "                      Main wing root twist\n",
    "                      Main wing center twist\n",
    "                      Main wing tip twist\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the optimization to converge, we needed to decrease the canard chord and span to decrease its lift.  The wing was broken into two sections to better enable compensation for the canard effects.  Decreasing the canard span also decreased the main wing center section span.  After running the optimization several times, we found that for a given canard initial twist, the optimizer would not change the canard very much, but would converge with a modified main wing twist distribution.  From a fundamental standpoint of drag at the Trefftz plane as described by Kroo, this makes sense due to the only factor contributing to induced drag is the downwash at the plane.  For a given canard lift distribution, there is a wing lift distrubution that minimizes the induced drag.  Our final run on the optimization resulted with the following, including a 3D visualization of the lift distribution on the wing and canard as well as a visualization of the streamlines for a sweep of angles:\n",

    "Once we had the CL of the wing we divided that by the span to find the Cl of a unit span. With Cl and Renyolds number we began comparing the performance of different airfoils based on three simple factors. First, we determined which airfoil, when at a zero angle of attack, most closely matched our desired Cl. Second, we determined which airfoil had the lowest Cd at our design Cl. Third, we considered which one had the highest L/D at a zero angle of attack. After comparing our best airfoils from Homework 2 (E211, Clark Y, Naca 4412, Naca 4415) we determined that the E211 would be the best fit. While its L/D at a zero angle of attack was slightly higher than some of the other options, based on its Cl at alpha=0 it outperformed the other airfoils.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the airfoil known, the CL max of the wing was calculated using the airfoil max local cl of 1.4.  We increased the system angle of attack and measured the span lift distribution until the local lift distribution exceeded the airfoil max cl.  At this point, we evaluated the system CL.  The stall speed was calculated by evaluating the aircraft at decreasing flight speeds, but at the maximum angle of attack, until the lift generated equaled the weight. A summary of these results can be found below, including a visual of the wing critical section being in the root area:\n",

    "\n",
    "We should note that the VLM solves using thin airfoil theory, however the airfoil we have chosen uses camber and has a non-zero zero lift angle of attack.  The zero-lift angle of attack for the Eppler 211 is approximately -5 degrees.  Therefore, when we mount the wing, we will need to decrease the mounting angle by 5 degrees.  The final 3D representation in drawings can be seen below (please note that the fuselage was not included in the inviscid lift and drag calculations for this phase of design):\n",

    "While the 3D representations are useful, 2D drawings present a clear way to show our design. The fuselage size and wing placement are nominal, the second drawing labels the local twist and chord for the three defining locations on the wing. The canard has a constant cross section and is therefore fully defined with the definition of the airfoil and twist. For the main wing, the three sections used are the centerline, directly behind the canard, and the tip. The point behind the canard was chosen as a control point to help get an elliptical lift profile. For these sections, the point indicated on the leading edge shows where the chord is located. This is numerically defined in the distance (orthogonal) from the centerline as labeled in the Airfoil cross-sections table. The chord themselves are perpendicular to the sweep angle and the centerline airfoil will be trimmed to fit cleanly in the body.\n",

    "2) For the cutting process, our main wing was divided into four separate sections.  A root section and tip section for both sides of the plane.  Our wing had sweep, taper, and twist.  We cut each section accounting for the taper and twist of each separate part.  However, we decided it would be easier to do the sweep manually.  Cutting the wing exposed some manufacturing difficulties that we will address in the next phase of design.  Because the method of cutting the wing availaible to us uses a simple hot wire, any taper causes the wire to travel faster on one size than the other.  This resulted in more melted foam on the side with the slower moving carriage.  We found this to generate significant error on the slower end of the wire, which made the interface between the sections on the main wing nearly impossible without significant post processing.  Becuase of this, we will likely only include the root and tip sections in our wing for the future design.  This may yield less optimal results as far as span efficiency is concerned, but will still be adequate for the mission requirements.  Additionally, taper presented further hardships associated with the cutting process.  The measured distance of the carriages and the foam had to be exact or the wing would not be correctly cut.  This resulted in an inaccurate taper of the cut wing and thus some of the chord lengths did not match that which was calculated and programmed.  As a result, we know to ensure accuracy in our measurements on the next cut of the wing.  Furthermore, upon completion of the canard wing, we realized the wing was thinner than expected.  This leads to structural concerns which will be addressed in post processing.\n",
