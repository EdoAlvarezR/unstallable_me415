    "The preliminary dimensions of plane were based on general proportions that we saw from looking at actual canard aircraft. As for the location and type of tail we used, we determined this based on simplicity and the fact that we are building a canard. Having a single vertical tail in the middle seemed more simple (structurally and for controls) than winglets did and since we are running two propellers and by placing the vertical tail in the middle it is located outside our propeller wakes (which would decrease its effectiveness) . As for a horizontal tail this role is filled by our canard wing in the front. Then once we had the basic dimensions we performed more specific sizing of the vertical tail and horizontal canard using the statistical tail sizing equations discussed in class.\"\n",
    "    \"By changing the projected surface area of the tail and keeping the other values we arrived at an initial Vv value of 0.03 that fell right in the middle of the recommended range of 0.02-0.04. Through iterations this value did change as the center of gravity was moved in order to arrive at a stable design. As for the canard (or “horizontal tail”) we used the value that we had originally found when trying to optimize our lift in the past homework. However, when we began to run our stability analysis we ran into instability issues and had to make our canard wing much larger. Through iteration, we ended up with a Vh value of 0.615 which is right in the recommended 0.5-0.7 range. In retrospect, it would have been better to give the canard an approximate size based on statistical tail sizing rather than based on our lift analysis from the last homework.\n",

    "For this step we opted to layout the whole aircraft directly in Xflr5. Initially we determined the mass locations based on intuition and basic design choices. The fact that we were designing a pusher led to putting the motor and propeller in the rear of the plane. As for the rest of point masses in the plane, we put the parts like the servo next to the control surface they would be moving and then tried to get most of the other mass near the center of the plane. Originally we had the design set up for one motor, but through analyzing our total mass and the motors we will be given we decided that for our first plane iteration we want to use two motors. This design change along with subsequent iterations caused our center of gravity to move around a lot; however, through iteration we eventually arrived at a stable design. As can be seen in the image below our center of gravity moved toward the rear of the plane in our final design.\n",

    "Though we had high hopes to use FLOWVLM for the entire project, when it came to computing stability derivatives and including strip theory, we decided to switch to xflr5.  We modeled the aircraft design from homework 3, including Austin's tail design and masses (electronics, battery, motor, and prop) for the moment calculations.  The figure below shows the lift to drag versus flight speed for all three aircraft analyzed in this section.  The Eppler 211 and NACA 0012 were run using the built in xfoil analysis for a wide range of Reynolds numbers from 10,000 to 1,000,000.  The NACA 0012 was only used on the vertical fin.\n",

    "The aircraft from HW 3 was optimized for the highest lift to drag ratio including the canard effects.  The lift to drag ratio was indeed much higher than in HW 2.  However, as can be seen in the table below, the lift coefficient was much lower which would afford much more room to climb with the main wing. Interestingly, the HW 3 design had a higher flight speed which was likely due to a decrease in induced drag which resulted in a higher flight velocity and in turn greater lift for the same drag.  The general trends of both curves were quite similar as expected.\n",

    "Because we had optimized the aircraft twist distribution to account for the canard on wing interaction, we were fairly confident with out design.  However, after we cut out our wing and found out the difficulty of matching tapered sections, we decided to to update the design to include a constant taper ratio and make the half span a single section.  Even though the root and tip section twists were re-optimized using FLOWVLM for minimum system induced drag, the change did increase the drag.  The design in HW 3 also neglected to add dihedral, which we decided to include for roll stability. Finally, we found that the canard was stalling and needed a lower CL, so we increased both the span and the chord, which also created more drag from the interference on the main wing and added wetted area.  A summary of the changes can be seen below.\n",

    "Our design angle of attack is approximately 0 degrees due to the Eppler 211 cambered airfoil we have chosen.  This operating point approximately corresponds with the velocity for the maximum lift to drag ratio for the airfraft. We found that two factors were important in generating a moment coefficient that crossed the origin and had a negative slope: center of gravity position and canard lift.  We found that by moving the electronics forward, the slope of the Cm vs Alpha plot became more negative, and the canard lift made it somewhat less negative but more so changed to y intercept.  We originally wanted the canard to be close to 0 degrees incidence angle due to the use of the same Eppler 211 cambered airfoil as on the wing, but we found that approximately 0.8 degrees of incidence angle was required.  The plot of the Moment Coefficient can be seen below.\n",

    "We wanted to make sure that the canard still would stall before the main wing and would afford adequate angle of attack for the main wing for climbing.  We did this by increasing the canard incidence, which is equivalent to increasing the camber with a control surface and noting the new 0 moment angle of attack.  We found that by increaseing the canard incidence angle to 2 degrees, the moment was zero at 8 degrees system angle of attack, and the canard would stall (local cl values required were above the airfoil data). From this analysis, we feel confident that this design is not only stall proof, but also affords ample angle of attack for climb and a stall speed of 7 m/s.\n",

    "Originally, following the tutorial video's instructions the vehicle was redesigned to attain a positive moment for a negative angle of attack.  This gave the plane natural stability.  The  canard was redesigned with a longer chord and span.  This gave the plane more lift.  In addition, we moved the center of gravity back by moving movable components backwards.  Additionally, we added a dihedral to the wing.  When the aircraft still did not attain a positive moment, we realized there must be some other error.  Upon examination of the masses of the vehicle, it was discovered that the body's mass was way too large.  Recalculating the mass of the body with the correct density reduced the mass by a third.  After, the prerequisite stability requirements were met. Since in the beginning there was a great deal of alteration of the canard, masses, and the vertical wing, it was decided to analyze the plane again with a greater dihedral because the effects were not know.  We increased the dihedral angle to 10 degrees.  The following results were obtained:\n",
