    "Though we had high hopes to use FLOWVLM for the entire project, when it came to computing stability derivatives and including strip theory, we decided to switch to xflr5.  We modeled the aircraft design from homework 3, including Austin's tail design and included all the masses needed (electronics, battery, motor, and prop) for the moment calculations.  The figure below shows the lift to drag versus flight speed for all three aircraft analyzed in this section.  We will focus on the aircraft from HW 2 and 3 here.\n",

    "\n",
    "The aircraft from HW 3 was optimized for the highest lift to drag ratio including the canard effects.  The lift to drag ratio was indeed much higher than in HW 2.  However, as can be seen in the table below, the lift coefficient was much lower which would afford much more room to climb with the main wing. Interestingly the HW 3 design had a higher flight speed which was likely due to a decrease in induced drag which resulted in a higher flight velocity and in turn greater lift for the same drag.  The general trends of both curves were quite similar as expected.\n",

    "Because we had optimized the aircraft twist distribution to account for the canard on wing interaction, we were fairly confident with out design.  However, after we cut out our wing and found out the difficulty of matching tapered sections, we decided to to update the design to include a constant taper ratio and make the half span a single section.  Even though the root and tip section twists were re-optimized using FLOWVLM for minimum system induced drag, the change did increase the drag.  The design in HW 3 also neglected to add dihedral, which we decided to include for roll stability. Finally, we found that the canard was stalling and needed a lower CL, so we increased both the span and the chord, which also created more drag from the interference on the main wing and added wetted area.  A summary of the changes can be seen below.\n",

    "Our design angle of attack is approximately 0 degrees due to the Eppler 211 cambered airfoil we have chosen.  This operating point approximately corresponds with the velocity for the maximum lift to drag ratio for the airfraft. We found that two factors were important in generating a moment coefficient that crossed the origin and had a negative slope: center of gravity position and canard lift.  We found that by moving the electronics forward, the slope of the Cm vs Alpha plot became more negative, and the canard lift made it somewhat less negative but more so changed to y intercept.  We originally wanted the canard to be close to 0 degrees incidence angle due to the use of the same Eppler 211 cambered airfoil as on the wing, but we found that approximately 0.8 degrees of incidence angle was required.  The plot of the Moment Coefficient can be seen below.\n",

    "We wanted to make sure that the canard still would stall before the main wing and would afford adequate angle of attack for the main wing for climbing.  We did this by increasing the canard incidence, which is equivalent to increasing the camber with a control surface and noting the new 0 moment angle of attack.  We found that by increaseing the canard incidence angle to 2 degrees, the moment was zero at 8 degrees system angle of attack, and the canard would stall (local cl values required were above the airfoil data). From this analysis, we feel confident that this design is not only stall proof, but also affords ample angle of attack for climb and a stall speed of 7 m/s.\n",

This value was already pretty close to the aircraft's center of gravity.  However, to match this value the placement of the electronics was moved by 10 mm."

The derivative of the pitching moment with respect to alpha should be negative, again matching the xfoil analysis.  The derivative of n with respect to the slide slip angle should be positive.  Lastly, the derivative of roll with respect to the slide slip angle should be negative.  Thus the results of the stability derivates demonstrate the vehicle is laterally and longitudinally stable.\n"
