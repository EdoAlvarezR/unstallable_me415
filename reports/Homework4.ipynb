Multiplying the static margin by the mean aerodynamic chord resulting in a center of gravity that was 22.1271 mm in front of the neutral point thus a distance of 49.3 mm from the leading edge.  This value was already pretty close to the aircraft's center of gravity.  However, to match this value the placement of the electronics was moved by 10 mm."
